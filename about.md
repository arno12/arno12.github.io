Working as a Data Analyst for the past few years, I have learned to leverage complex data flows into efficient processing steps that enable me to derive actionable insights that can empower stakeholders.

I particularly enjoy taking part in the creation of predictive models using a wide range of statistical methods and communicating insights through data visualization. I am a fan of R's Tidyverse packages.

Looking for a compact summary of all this?

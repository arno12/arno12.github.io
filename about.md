Hello.

I am a recent Research Master Graduate in Communication Science from the University of Amsterdam.
Writing about world events is important to me because I feel a responsibility to stay informed and critical about the increasingly entertainment-based information that we are exposed to every day.
I believe in open-source communities to bring the best out of governance and social actions. 
The novel ways in which data can be used to deliver valuable insights in an interactive way passionates me.
I am currently looking for a new challenge, feel free to reach out to me!

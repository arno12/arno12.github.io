I've created this website to have a space where I could share about subjects that mattered to me.

On the left, you will find a Blog section that contains a set of articles about a variety of topic - some are political, others are more personal.

There is also a Data section containing the posts that are more related to my day-to-day inside a digital organization. If I come across an interesting challenge that lacks online resources, I will try to share about it. Other than that, I'm also very enthusiastic about data viz, and I follow the great [#TidyTuesday community](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - sometimes partaking in it. You can find more information about it on Twitter.

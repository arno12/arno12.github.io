### Three nights, two days

That's all it took. That's all it took for me to fall in love with the city. Over the past few days, many people asked me to describe the trip and I often found myself obliged to decline a proper answer for a lack of appropriate vocabulary that would describe the experience. Intense, euphorical, mesmerizing, these are all adjectives that I could paste on a large billboard that would struggle to represent a fraction of my trip.

#### Berlin, you converted me. Or maybe I converted myself to you. 

While in the middle of your chaos, I found art, I found passion, I found spirit and I found beauty. Along your wide avenues, your abandonned buildings and your beaming lights, I walked at night to the rythm of the grounding bass still resonating at dawn from your many clubs, shaking the sidewalks at regular intervals, like a beating heart pumps blood to trigger life. 

But it's not only the nightlife that conquered me, it's also the people that find themselves in that environment that I cannot forget. As if united under the same banner, the same vision, that of a global, borderless inclusion. No wonder you're so welcoming of those who need shelter. You understand better than anyone the richness that lies in diversity. In all your aspects, you have learned from harsh division to accomodate as many signs of multiculturality as you could.

I don't know if I could linger in Berlin for years, the emotions that got me were too strong, to the points where I cannot imagine the effect that its sparkling life would have on me over time. Yet at the same time such uncertainty seduces me and calls my name for new challenges and new discoveries. 

Berlin, to me, you were the theater of a grand reunion, with people I intensely love and with whom I want to share everything, unconditionally, and unstoppably. I want to feel your cold shaking me inside, I want to feel your industrial vibe beating all the time.
